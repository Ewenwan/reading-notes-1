The `definitive` guide to professional game development.
Game Engine Architecture covers both the `theory and practice` of game engine software development, bringing together complete coverage of a wide range of topics. The concepts and techniques described are the actual ones used by real game studios like Electronic Arts and Naughty Dog. The examples are often grounded in specific technologies, but the discussion extends way beyond any particular engine or API. The references and citations provided in this book make it a great jumping off point for those who wish to dig deeper into any particular aspect of the game development process.
This book is intended to serve as the course text for `a college level series in game programming`. It can also be used by amateur software engineers, hobbyists, self-taught game programmers and existing members of the game industry alike. Junior game engineers can use this text to solidify their understanding of game technology and engine architecture. Even senior engineers who specialize in one particular field of game development can benefit from the bigger picture presented in these pages.
