说明：我在写作《全局光照技术》的时候，第一步做的工作就是对渲染相关的图形学论文进行分类整理，这样能使我对各种算法的类别，思想，使用的数学知识等有清晰的认识，以使该书的内容结构更加稳固，全面，能够覆盖从理论到实践，从基础原理到工业中的最佳实践，以及行业中最重要的那些趋势。当我第一次在摩点的众筹中展示该项工作的时候，很多朋友表示对其分类工作感兴趣，我承诺这个工作一定会公开。但是考虑到单纯一个分类对其他人可能并没有太大价值，比如每个分类的依据，涉及的理论等需要有简单的解释，才能更好的帮助别人，所以我本打算在书完成之后建一个论文索引网站，其功能不仅包含分类，还有对每个分类原理的基本说明，每个方法类别的基本描述，甚至包含专有名词的翻译，论文下载地址等。

但是，还是经常收到邮件等要求提前了解一下，所以这里先简单列出一些，等图书完成之后会考虑怎样以更好的方式让这个工作的价值最大化。另一方面，主要是希望借此让大家一起讨论你认为这个网站应该具有什么样的形式和具有哪些功能更有实际意义，我的部分想法在留言中，欢迎大家献计献策。

目前仅包含光线/路径追踪（Ray/Path Tracing），光子映射（Photon Mapping）和梅特波利斯光照传输（Metropolis Light Transport）三个部分的内容，分类标题被加粗了，暂时没有精力做太多更细的整理。
